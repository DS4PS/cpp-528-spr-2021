### Collaboration Tools  

This topic has three parts: 

**Part I**

I only have one question for you: what pain point did you experience this week? If you could go back in time, how would you resolve these problems?

---

**Part II**

Which aspects of the collaboration tools have you found useful? 

Which parts have been awkward or challenging? 


--- 

**Part III**

If you were managing a large project with many waves of data, your recommendations have real consequences for how resources will be allocated through a federal program, you are the lead for a team of 7 analysts, and analysis that is complex enough that no one team member has all of the skills needed to generate the deliverables. 

Does the usefulness of the project management tools change with the complexity of the project?
