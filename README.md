## How to update course website

Welcome to CPP 528! To update the course website to reflect the current semester, please update two files:

* [`index.md`](index.md): to reflect who is teaching CPP 528 and other essential logistics
    + update the `info` section
    + update the `instructor` section
* [`_config.yml`](_config.yml): to ensure the course website points to the correct GitHub repo
    + update the `author` section
    + update the `GitHub Configuration` section
        + specifically the `baseurl` and `course_url`
            + i.e. from `...-fall-2020` to `...-spr-2021`
    + update the `github_info` section:
        + specifically the `website-repo` and `course-repo`
            + i.e. from `...-fall-2020` to `...-spr-2021`
